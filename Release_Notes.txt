 Source code changes:
   prepobs_cqcbufr.fd/cqcbufr.f (main program):
    - Corrected an integer overflow issue which prevented the temporal
      check from running in the CDAS network (the only network where it
      currently would run).
      BENEFIT: This QC check now runs in the CDAS PREP2 jobs.

( M - modified)


 USH script changes:
   prepobs_makeprepbufr.sh:
    - Use NCO-established variables to point to root directories for main
      software components and input/output directories in order to run on WCOSS
      Phase 1 or Phase 2:
       - $COMROOT which replaces hardwire to "/com".
       - $NWROOT which replaces hardwire to "/nwprod" (in comments only).
    - Use NCO-established variables (presumably obtained from modules) to point
      to prod utilities:
       - $NDATE from module prod_util (default or specified version, loaded in
         each network which executes this script in this version of
         obsproc_prep) which replaces executable ndate in non-versioned,
         horizontal structure utility directory path defined by imported
         variable $utilexec.
    - Use NCO-established variables to point to prod utilities.

 Source code changes:
   load_libs.rc and setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Increment the bufrlib version from v10.2.5 to v11.1.0.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Point to /nwprod2 copy of all libs managed by NCO except for sigio.
   (Note: prepobs_prepdata and syndat_syndata hang in the call to gblevents if
          compiled with /nwprod2 build of sigio.v2.0.1 and the current build of
          w3emc.v2.2.0.  The latter was compiled with sigio.v1.0.1.  Thus we
          will stick with /nwprod build of sigio.v1.0.1 for codes that call
          gblevents until w3emc lib is updated to use the newer sigio lib, or
          gblevents is moved to another library, or such.)
   prepobs_prepdata.fd/prepdata.f (main program):
    - Encodes new cloud ceiling (CEILING) values into PREPBUFR file for 
      ADPSFC message types; this new field is derived from existing
      cloud amount (CLAM) and height of cloud base (HOCB) data in METAR 
      reports (TYP=512).  
      BENEFIT: Provides single location for data supporting cloud ceiling
               ANALYSIS IN RTMA/URMA NETWORKS.

 Fixed file changes:
   prepobs_prep.bufrtable:
    - Added support for cloud ceiling information in ADPSFC METAR reports:
      new Table D sequence CLOU3SEQ and new Table B mnemonic CEILING.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
  (For specific network changes see " Output changes" in Release Notes for that
   network, if that network executes this version of obsproc_prep.)


 Libraries:

   * all libs except sigio are WCOSS phase2 disk (/nwprod2/*) versions


 Build Instructions:
 -------------------
   - See sorc/README.build


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   There are no jobs in obsproc_prep.  Jobs executing this version of
   obsproc_prep will be tested.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   See information about dissemination in the release notes for
   obsproc_<NETWORK> packages which execute this version of obsproc_prep.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v6.1.0.
   This must be implemented before or simultaneously with the implementation
   of rtma.v2.4.3 and urma.v2.4.3.

   Since there are no jobs in obsproc_prep, an obsproc_prep.ver file is not
   needed.

( A - added)
( M - modified)


 USH script changes:
   prepobs_prepacqc.sh:
    - Export FORT41 (Fortran unit number 41) as vvel_info.acft_profiles.txt;
      file will hold printout from vertical velocity rate calculation
      information for QC'd merged aircraft reports written to profiles.
      BENEFIT: Isolates it from stdout and keeps amount of stdout manageable.

 Source code changes:
   prepobs_prepacqc:
      prepacqc (main program):
       - Increased maximum number of merged reports that can be processed
         "max_reps" from 220K to 300K.
         BENEFIT: The number of merged reports currently processed routinely
                  exceeds 90% of 220K, so it is getting close to the limit.
                  More and more reports are expected in the future.
       - Added new namelist switches "l_mandlvl" and "tsplines" (used by
         subroutine sub2mem_mer, see below).
       - Minor corrections in Docblock, comments.
      acftobs_qc (subroutine):
       - Added a print statement.
      sub2mem_mer (subroutine):
       - Modified the calculation of vertical velocity rate in profiles (if
         they are processed). Previously, could only be done via finite-
         difference method calculated for descents. Now can be done via
         either:
            1)  finite-difference method calculated for both ascents and
                descents using the nearest neighboring pair which are at least
                one minute apart (when new namelist switch tsplines=F), or
            2)  use of Jim Purser's tension-spline interpolation utility to get
                continuous gradient results in a profile (when new namelist
                switch tsplines=T, the default).
       - New namelist switch "l_mandlvl" allows the interpolation of obs data
         to mandatory levels in the profile calculation to now be skipped
         (l_mandlvl=F).  Prior to this, code was hardwired to always
         interpolate obs data to mandatory levels (now represented by
         l_mandlvl=T, the default).
       - Minor corrections in Docblock, comments.
      output_acqc_noprof (subroutine):
       - Fixed a bug which, for cases where the maximum number of merged
         reports that can be processed ("max_reps") is exceeded, prevented any
         original reports above "max_reps" from being written out (without any
         QC).
         BENEFIT: Allows all of the original aircraft reports to get to the
                  GSI, even if some do not have any QC from prepobs_prepacqc.
                  The GSI may be able to do its own QC on some of these data.
                  Prevents all reports in PREPBUFR message type "AIRCFT" from
                  being missing (this could cause downstream problems; possible
                  since PREPBUFR processes reports from the "aircar" dump
                  followed by reports from "aircft" dump, and the vast majority
                  of reports are from the "aircar" dump).
      output_acqc_prof (subroutine):
       - Pass "l_mandlvl" and "tspline" into subroutine sub2mem_mer.
       - Minor corrections in Docblock, comments.
      input_acqc (subroutine):
       - Minor corrections in Docblock.
       - Added a print statement.
      pietc, pkind, pmat, pmat2, pmat3, pspl (f90 subroutines):
       - New. Jim Purser's package of regular and and tensioned splines.
         [These will eventually be placed in a library since these can be
          applied in many applications. For more information about this
          package, please refer to R.J. Purser, Y. Zhu, and B.A. Ballish,
          2014: Recovery of aircraft vertical motion profiles from incomplete
          data -- an application of the method of splines. NOAA/NCEP Office
          Note (In preparation). 35 pages.]
      makefile:
       - Added the six new f90 subroutines (see above).
       - Removed "-fixed" ifort compiler option since it is a default for
         *.f routines and cannot be used for *.f90 routines (allows *.f and
         *.f90 to use same compiler options).
       - Added default compiling rules for *.f vs. *.f90 subroutines.
       - Includes dependencies for generating certain object files in this
         program.
      BENEFIT: The splines obtain more continuously smooth aircraft vertical
               velocity and mitigate the missing time information. The aircraft
               vertical motion profiles are recovered from incompletely known
               temporal reference data by exploiting the inherent smoothing
               property of spline functions.  
   prepobs_cqcvad:
      cqcvad (main program):
       - Adjusted size definition of UW, VW, and MSK arrays to
         utilize NSTN, NTIMES, and NINC rather than explicitly stating
         the size of 3600.
         BENEFIT:  This allows for more flexible and parameterized array
                   definitions.
   prepobs_prepdata:
      prepdata.f (main program):
       - All references to IR satellite-derived winds now expanded to refer to
         IR "long-wave".
         BENEFIT: Differentiates IR "long-wave" winds from IR "short-wave"
                  winds which are now produced from GOES but are not processed
                  by this program.
       - Skips over the reading of reports in "satwnd" dump coming from tanks
         NC005080 (AVHRR POES) and NC005090 (VIIRS POES) since these cannot be
         processed by this program.
         BENEFIT: Prevents diagnostic "invalid producer/sat combination"
                  printout from being generated for every report in these two
                  tanks.
       - Output argument "CBULL" returned from IW3UNPBF for unpacked reports
         (character*11 string containing WMO bulletin header and originator -
         filled only for aircraft types right now).
       - Encodes new, unique report subtype (TSB) values into PREPBUFR file for
         AIRCAR types based on WMO bulletin header/originator now returned from
         call to IW3UNPBF (see just above) (1-U.S. MDCRS, 2-Mexican MDCRS,
         3-ADS-C MDCRS, 99-default/unknown).
         BENEFIT: The GSI will be able to identify these types based on TSB.
       - Fixed several issues related to storage of SQN (sequence number):
         - Now initialized as 999990 instead of 99999.
         - Corrected bug which was not encoding it properly for AIRCAR type
           when SQN was > 99998.
         - Now encoded as missing rather than 99999 for types which do not
           store SQN.
         BENEFIT: Correct value of SQN encoded in PREPBUFR files.  Prevents
                  possible falure in downstream PREPOBS_PREPACQC program since
                  it uses SQN to ensure indexing is correct when events are
                  written to PREPBUFR file. (Note: This failure could only
                  occur in runs that do not split PREPOBS_PREPDATA into
                  separate tasks (i.e., non-operational runs.)
       - Added new namelist switch TDMAX, defined as the upper limit for
         acceptable dewpoint temperature obs (the moisture on any level, for
         any report type, with dewpoint temperature on that level > TDMAX will
         be flagged with QM=15 in the PREPBUFR file if it is not already
         flagged as bad). (Default is 999.K, not invoked).
         BENEFIT: The moisture on report levels with very high (and likely
                  invalid) dewpoint temperature obs will not be considered by a
                  particular network's analysis if TDMAX is set in that
                  network's prepdata parm cards. This value is network
                  dependent.
       - Updated land/sea check in subr. LNDCHK for N.H. surface marine
         reports.  Now has option (under certain conditions) to check 16 points
         around obs lat/lon location {4 inner points as before (which is still
         an option) plus also now 12 points in next, outer ring}.  If any one
         of the 16 points is over water, the obs is deemed over water. On the
         mask boundary (i.e., Prime Meridian or Equator), check reverts back to
         only surrounding 4 points since 1 or more mask points are not stored
         in outer 12 point ring in this case.  Several additional mask points
         in key geographical locations known to be over water are also
         converted from over land to over water (after being read in). 
         BENEFIT: It is known that many valid N.H. marine ship and buoy reports
                  at the coastline are being flagged as over land (and not used
                  by the analysis) due to their imprecise lat/lon. This change
                  will allow these to now be used by the analysis, but it will
                  still flag reports with invalid lat or lon (when it results
                  in them being well inland).
       - Fixed bug in GOES total cloud cover (TOCC) encoding in subr. GOESDG.
         Now populates CLTOP(1,2) with TOCC value directly from RDATA2(25)
         passed from W3UNPKB7 (had looked for it in cat 8 c.f. 258 passed in
         from W3UNPKB7 in RDATA array but this was changed long ago to hold
         cloud amount and not total cloud cover, and the former is missing in
         GOES cloud reports). RDATA2 is expanded to size 25 in W3UNPKB7 in
         order to store TOCC, and this is accounted for here.
         BENEFIT: PREPBUFR report type 151 (GOES cloud reports, now store a non-
                  missing TOCC value.  This information may eventually be used
                  in the RTMA/URMA).
      w3unpkb7.f (subroutine):
       - RDATA2 is expanded to size 25 in order to store total cloud cover
         (TOCC) (present in dumps of GOES cloud reports).
      iw3unpbf.f (subroutine):
       - Added logic to handle new NASA/VIIRS (NPP) POES winds in tank NC005090
         (e.g., recognizes that they now exist, counts of reports with flagged
         QI values, counts of reports by satellite number). Added logic to
         properly handle GOES IR short-wave winds in tank NC005019 (e.g., new
         instrument type 19, process the quality information correctly). Added
         some missing logic which summarizes processing of NESDIS/AVHRR POES
         winds in tank NC005080 (e.g., counts of reports by satellite number).
         BENEFIT: NASA/VIIRS (NPP) POES winds, GOES IR short-wave winds and
                  NESDIS/AVHRR POES winds will all be translated properly from
                  the "satwnd" dumps.  (Although they will not be processed by
                  prepobs_prepdata they are listed by bufr_listdumps which uses
                  this same dump-interface subroutine.)
       - Now stores WMO bulletin header and originator in new output
         character*11 argument CBULL for aircraft data (only) (all blanks for
         all other data types for now). (Note: Previously, WMO bulletin
         originator had been stored in characters 1-4 of header reserve
         character word 1 and bulletin header was not stored.)
         BENEFIT: This information may be included in PREPBUFR files someday.
                  It is used to tag MDCRS types in report subtype (TSB) which
                  is encoded into PREPBUFR.

( M - modified)


 Source code changes:
   prepobs_prepdata:
      prepdata (main program):
       - Removed input argument "IDATE" (central date) from call to subroutine
         W3CNVXTOVS since year {IDATE(1)} is no longer needed to obtain BUFR
         satellite ID (see changes to subroutine W3CNVXTOVS below).
      w3xtovseds (subroutine):
       - Handles new satellites METOP-1 (BUFR satellite ID 3, converted to
         local satellite ID 10), NOAA-19 (BUFR satellite ID 223, converted to
         local satellite ID 9) and NPP (BUFR satellite ID 224, converted to
         local satellite ID 11).
         BENEFIT: The primary POES constellation NOAA-19 (PM) and METOP-1(B)
                  (AM) are now ingested and dumped in place of previous POES
                  constellation NOAA-18 (PM) and METOP-2(A) (AM) in the CDAS
                  and GDAS networks. These are now recogized by the CDAS
                  PREPBUFR steps which still process ATOVS soundings.  NPP is
                  now the "official" PM POES constellation satellite, thus
                  the CDAS PREPBUFR steps will now also recognize it if its
                  sounding data products are ever dumped in place of NOAA-19
                  (NCEP/EMC does not yet have access to these data for
                  testing).
       - Now encodes BUFR satellite ID value (Code Table 0-01-007) into word 2
         of output array IBUFTN (previously a spare set to missing).
         BENEFIT: Allows subroutine W3CNVXTOVS to obtain this value directly
                  rather than calculating it back from local/NESDIS satellite
                  ID value in word 1 of IBUFTN (see below).
      w3cnvxtovs (subroutine):
       - Now obtains the BUFR satellite ID (for storing into output array
         IDATA) directly from value now stored in word 2 of input array IBUFTN
         (via change to subroutine W3XTOVSEDS, see above) rather than
         calculating it from the local/NESDIS satellite ID stored in word 1 of
         IBUFTN.
         BENEFIT: Removes convoluted logic in previous calculation of BUFR
                  satellite ID which was based on central date year since,
                  unlike the BUFR satellite ID, the local/NESDIS satellite ID
                  is not unique for each satellite. Also this subroutine will
                  never again have to be updated to account for new satellites.
       -  Removed input argument IDATE (central date) since year {IDATE(1)} is
          no longer needed to obtain BUFR satellite ID.

( M - modified)


 USH script changes:
   prepobs_prepacqc.sh:
    - If status code returned from running of prepobs_prepacqc is 4 (meaning no
      input aircraft reports of any type read in, see below), send a diagnostic
      message to the joblog file.  Also in this case, retain the original input
      PREPBUFR file as the working PREPBUFR file coming out of this script
      (since no changes are made to it).  Also in this case, do not run
      prepobs_prepacpf regardless of whether or not it was set to run in the
      upstream job script.
      BENEFIT: Notification when prepobs_prepacqc program stops because there
               were no aircraft reports in the input PREPBUFR file.  Overall
               PREPBUFR processing continues.

 Source code changes:
   load_libs.rc and setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Increment the sp version from v2.0.1 to v2.0.2 to link to the newest
      operational version of this library.
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - remove "module use -a /nwprod/lib/modulefiles" and
             "module avail"
      BENEFIT: No longer needed and can slow down compilation.
   prepobs_prepdata:
      prepdata (main program):
       - Added encoding of wind direction/speed quality mark (DFQ) for all
         types that already encode wind direction (DDO) and either wind speed
         in knots (FFO) or wind speed in m/sec (SOB). DFQ will now be encoded
         with overall wind quality mark in both cases when u-comp wind obs
         (UOB) and v-comp wind obs (VOB) are encoded [in which case DFQ will be
         the same as u-/v- comp quality mark (WQM)] and in cases when, for
         surface reports UOB and VOB are not encoded because either direction
         or speed is missing.
         BENEFIT: This change links WQM to only UOB and VOB.  Prior to this,
                  WQM could be filled for surface reports when UOB and VOB were
                  missing but either DDO or SOB were present. This led to
                  issues in the CDAS analysis (and perhaps in other GSI
                  systems). This change also links DFQ to only DDO and either
                  FFO ot SOB.  Prior to this, DFQ was always missing. In
                  addition, the entire W__EVENT sequence [UOB VOB WQM WPC WRC]
                  is now missing (and replaced with only a single 8-bit
                  replication value of zero) for surface reports when UOB and
                  VOB are both missing.  Prior to this, it had to be expanded
                  out since WQM was present in such stuations.
       - Added encoding of wind direction/speed program code (DFP) for surface
         reports in both cases when UOB and VOB are encoded [in which case DFP
         will be the same as u-/v- comp program code (WPC)] and in cases when
         UOB and VOB are not encoded because either direction or speed is
         missing.
         BENEFIT: This changes populates DFP in cases where it was always
                  missing before.
       - Added encoding of wind direction/speed reason code (DFR), if it is
         non-missing, in both cases when UOB and VOB are encoded [in which case
         DFR will be the same as u-/v- comp reason code (WRC)] and in cases
         when, for surface reports, UOB and VOB are not encoded because either
         direction or speed is missing.
         BENEFIT: This changes populates DFR in cases where it was always
                  missing before.
       - Added logic to reset longitude to 0.0 when it is very close to 360.0.
         BENEFIT:  This ensures that array clobbering will not occur if a
                   report (with high precision native lat/lon) is right at
                   Prime Meridian.
   prepobs_cqcvad:
    - Adjusted size of UW, VW, and MSK arrays from 1000 to 3600 to accommodate
      maximum potential size.
      BENEFIT:  This will eliminate array out of bounds situations that can
                cause the program to exit prematurely.
   prepobs_prepacqc:
      prepacqc (main program), input_acqc:
       - If no aircraft reports of any type are read from input PREPBUFR file
         by subroutine input_acqc, no further processing is performed in this
         subroutine other than the usual stdout print summary at its end.
         After its return back to the calling main program (prepacqc), the main
         program also, in this case, does no further processing.  Instead
         prepacqc stops with condition code 4 (to alert executing ush script
         prepobs_prepacqc.sh, see above) after printing a diagnostic message to
         stdout.
      BENEFIT: If there are no aircraft reports of any type in the input
               PREPBUFR file, this program will now stop with a non-fatal
               condition code 4 after printing diagnostic messages to stdout
               and to the (production) joblog file.  PREPBUFR processing will
               continue normally from this point on.  Prior to this, this
               program stopped with a fatal error resulting the the PREP job
               failing.
   syndat_syndata:
    - Changes made in entry VWNCOM to prevent array overflow in 2nd element of
      variable AXIWND when Mathur 2-D Vortex Routine is run.  (Note: This had
      occurred only when debugging was turned on at run time, which it still is
      in production.)
      BENEFIT: The code now runs to completion and generates bogus winds rather
               than stopping abnormally with condition code 152. The changes
               made here are "brute force" and may not be the ultimate best
               solution but they do yield the same output bogus winds (in one
               case checked) as when no changes were made but the code is run
               with debugging turned off.
    - Changes made in subroutine SURPRP to skip reading in wind obs from report
      levels in the vicinity of tropical systems if either UOB or VOB (or both)
      are missing.  (UOB and VOB are used to construct the bogus wind reports
      coming out of this program.)
      BENEFIT: UOB and/or VOB can now be missing for surface wind reports [as
               of an implementation on 24 June 2014 which introduces reports
               with only wind speed or only wind direction into the PREPBUFR
               files (encoded in SOB and DDO, resp.)].  Prior to this fix,
               missing values for UOB and VOB were generating nonsensical bogus
               winds or causing the program to stop abnormally with condition
               code 64.
    - Parameters LDXDIM and NDATMX (storage limit for number of observations in
      storm vicinity) increased from 500 to 1000 in subroutine CMPSIT.
      BENEFIT: There can be > 500 obs in the storm vicinity.  This change
               ensures that all obs are processed.
    - A trap remains set for arrays exceeding LDXDIM in entry ANLCOM and for
      arrays exceeding NDATMX in entry OWNCOM.  However, the trap for LDXDIM
      had to be fixed as it was previously invoked only when the limit was
      exceeded by 1.
      BENEFIT: Prevents array overflow (and program termination when debugging
               is turned on at run time). (These traps should not be hit since
               the limits LDXDIM and NDATMX have been now been increased, see
               change above).

 Fixed file changes:
   prepobs_prep.bufrtable (all related to changes in prepdata above):
    - 1) Added Table D event sequence W1_EVENT to record events for wind
         dir/speed (kts) for non-surface reports. This is added to Table D
         sequences PRSLEVEL and PRSLEVLA.
    - 2) Added Table D event sequence W2_EVENT to record events for wind
         dir/speed (m/sec) for surface reports. This is added to Table A
         entries ADPSFC, SFCSHP and MSONET.
    - 3) Table D sequence PRSLEVEL is replaced by
         CAT <P___INFO> <Q___INFO> <T___INFO> <Z___INFO> <W___INFO>
         in Table A entries ADPSFC, SFCSHP and MSONET and by
         CAT <P___INFO> <Z___INFO>
         in Table A entry SFCBOG.
    - 4) Removed Table D event sequence DF_EVENT as it is replaced by W1_EVENT
         and W2_EVENT.  This is removed from Table D sequence W___INFO.
    - 5) Removed Table D sequence WSPD_SEQ as it is replaced by W2_EVENT. This
         is removed from Table A entries ADPSFC, SFCSHP and MSONET.
    - 6) Updates to some Table B and D descriptions related to wind.

 USH script changes:
   prepobs_makeprepbufr.sh:
    - Imported script environment variable DICTPREP now defaults to new
      vertical structure directory path location for metar.tbl dictionary,
      /nw${envir}/decoders/decod_shared/dictionaries, rather than old
      horizontal structure location, /nw${envir}/dictionaries (the latter will
      be removed in September 2014).

 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - If environment variable $clobber is exported to this script with value
      "clobber_no", then the "make clobber" step is skipped. If $clobber not
      imported, "make clobber" will proceed as before.
      BENEFIT: This may be useful if one is debugging only one source code
               within a program with multiple source codes.
   README.build in sorc directory:
    - Updated to reflect changes in build.sh (see above).
   prepobs_prepacqc:
      prepacqc (main program):
       - Increased maximum number of flights that can be processed "maxflt"
         from 5000 to 7500.
         BENEFIT: Accounts for a gradual increase in aircraft reports over
                  recent months.  A recent production failure occurred when
                  there were 5002 flights.
       - Increased maximum number of merged reports that can be processed
         "max_reps" from 185K to 220K.
         BENEFIT: The number of merged reports currently processed routinely
                  exceeds 90% of 185K, so it is getting close to the limit.
                  More and more reports are expected in the future.
       - If subroutine acftobs_qc returns abnormally to main program due to the
         maximum value for number of flights calculated at some point during
         its processing exceeding "maxflt", program will no longer stop with
         r.c. 98.  Instead it will continue on with processing and post a
         diagnostic warning message to the production joblog file.
         BENEFIT: Program will no longer fail, but notification will be made
                  that "maxflt" needs to be increased a.s.a.p.  The vast
                  majority of output aircraft obs will still be QC'd (and maybe
                  even all will be QC'd if the number of flights barely exceeds
                  "maxflt").  All reports originally in the PREPBUFR file will
                  always be retained.  (Note that a gradual increase in the
                  number of flights will now eventually trigger a warning in
                  the production joblog when it get too close to "maxflt" - see
                  change to subroutine acftobs_qc below).
       - Increased format width from I5 to I6 in all places where aircraft obs
         index is listed out.
         BENEFIT: There are now > 99999 reports processed in most runs.  This
                  change will eliminate format integer overflow.
      acftobs_qc (subroutine) and its child subroutines:
       - Keeps track of maximum value for number of flights calculated at some
         point during processing.  If, at the end of processing, this value is
         at least 90% of the allowed limit ("maxflt", set in the main program),
         posts a diagnostic warning message to the production joblog file prior
         to exiting back to main program.
         BENEFIT: Provides a warning that "maxflt" is close to being hit and
                  that it should be increased in value before this happens.
                  There should be a sufficient time period of warning if the
                  number of reports is gradually increasing.
       - In subroutines do_flt and do_reg, return (abnormally) immediately if
         "maxflt" is exceeded [rather than waiting to test for this at end of
         do_flt and do_reg, and then returning (abnormally) as before].
         BENEFIT:  Avoids the potential clobbering of memory in these cases.
       - In subroutine reorder, where any new flight exceeding "maxflt"
         replaces the previous flight at index "maxflt" in the arrays to avoid
         an array overflow (done in two places in original NRL version), now
         posts a diagnostic warning message to the production joblog file.
         BENEFIT: Provides a warning that "maxflt" is exceeded here and that
                  some flights may contain reports not fully QC'd.
          - Related to above, found a third instance where this needs to be
            done in subr. reorder.
            BENEFIT: The original NRL version did not trap it and arrays
                     limited to length "maxflt" would have overflowed).
       - If "maxflt" is exceeded in subr. dupchk (1 place possible) or in subr.
         do_flt (2 places possible), the abnormal return back to
         subr. acftobs_qc results in subr. acftobs_qc now continuing on but
         setting a flag for "maxflt_exceeded".  Prior to this, subr.
         acftobs_qc itself immediately performed an abnormal return back to
         main program in such cases resulting in no more NRL QC processing.
         BENEFIT: NRL QC processing will continue on to the end of subr.
                  acftobs_qc where the abnormal return back to the main program
                  will be triggered by the "maxflt_exceeded" flag.  This should
                  allow nearly full QC to still be performed in this situation.

( M - modified)


 USH script changes:
   prepobs_makeprepbufr.sh:
    - Imports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_prep which points to
      directory path for generic prep subdirectories under version control (in
      production this is normally /nwprod/obsproc_prep.vX.Y.Z where X.Y.Z
      version number being used, usually the latest).  This replaces
      /nw${envir}.
    - Imports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_network which points to
      directory path for network-specific prep subdirectories under version
      control (in production this is normally /nwprod/obsproc_NETWORK.vX.Y.Z
      where NETWORK is, e.g., global, nam, rap, rtma, urma, and X.Y.Z is
      version number being used, usually the latest).  This replaces
      /nw${envir}.
    - Removed all references to RUC and CDC networks (obsolete).
    - Added references to URMA network.
    - Removed option to run on MACHINE=sgi - this is obsolete (as a result
      variables $MACHINE and $HOMEALL are no longer used in this script).
    - Replaced variable $EXECUTIL with $utilexec for directory path to utility
      program ndate (both were exported from job scripts with same value,
      $EXECUTIL has now been removed from all parent PREP job scripts).
   prepobs_syndata.sh:
    - Modified export variable FORT14 to point to renamed fix file:
      syndat_syndata.slmask.t126.gaussian 
   prepobs_prevents.sh
    - Removed all references to CDC network (obsolete).
    - Added references to URMA network.
   prepobs_cqcbufr.sh, prepobs_cqcvad.sh, prepobs_oiqcbufr.sh,
   prepobs_prepacqc.sh, prepobs_profcqc.sh: 
    - No changes (other than move to vertical structure).
      
 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to build one or all executables in the *.fd sub-directories of
      the sorc directory.  Reads either load_libs.rc or setlibs.rc file to
      point to library version numbers needed by makefiles.
   clean.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to "make clean" one or more *.fd sub-directories in the sorc
      directory (generally after a build).
   install.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to install (move) one or more executables (after build) in exec
      directory (assumed to be in same root directory as sorc).
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefiles.  (Not read if setlibs.rc is read.)
   README.build in sorc directory:
    - New. Documentation on using build.sh, install.sh and clean.sh.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefiles.  (Not read if load_libs.rc is read.)
   All source codes:
    - Makefile modified to use environment variables to point to library
      version numbers and to add sample build script and info in sorc
      directory.  This generalizes the library version information.
   prepobs_cqcbufr, prepobs_listheaders, prepobs_monoprepbufr,
   prepobs_mpcopybufr, prepobs_oiqcbufr, prepobs_prepacpf, prepobs_prevents,
   prepobs_profcqc, syndat_syndata:
    - No change to source.
   prepobs_prepdata, prepobs_prevents, syndat_syndata:
      gblevents (in w3emc library - version 2.2.0):
       - Added new namelist switch "DOPMSL" which, when TRUE, derives pmsl
         (mnemonic "PMO") from reported station pressure ("POB"), station
         height/elevation ("ZOB") and the just-computed virtual temperature for
         surface reports in cases when pmsl initially encoded in PREPBUFR file
         by prepobs_prepdata is missing (including all mesonet reports)
         (derivation done in subroutine GBLEVN08).  DOVTMP
         must be TRUE and DOANLS must be FALSE ("PREVENTS" mode). The derived
         pmsl either gets a quality mark ("PMQ") of 3 or inherits the station
         pressure quality mark ("PQM"), whichever is greater. The value of the
         pmsl indicator (new mnemonic "PMIN") is set to 1 to denote pmsl was
         derived rather than observed.  The default for "DOPMSL" is FALSE
         (normally only TRUE in RTMA and URMA runs).  It is forced to be FALSE
         in "POSTEVENTS" mode (DOANLS=TRUE).
         BENEFIT: More complete and thorough pressure information for surface
                  data is available in the RTMA and URMA GSI via this derived
                  pmsl since many more reports will have a pmsl now (whether
                  observed or derived).  The RTMA/URMA GSI analyzes pmsl.
       - In subroutine GBLEVN02, SFCSHP reports with calm winds and non-missing
         background u- or v-component wind .ge. 5 m/sec are flagged with Q.M. 8
         (event pgm "PREVENT", reason code 8).
         BENEFIT: These data are suspect and will now not be assimilated by any
                  GSI system.
   prepobs_cqcvad:
    - Increased total number of levels amongst all VAD reports that can be
      processed and total number of events amongst all VAD reports that can be
      processed from 160000 to 500000.
      BENEFIT: This increase will accommodate both (Radar Coded Message) and
               Level 2 decoder VAD wind reports.
    - Generated a new dynamic variable "icntmx" (product of number of stations
      reporting (max=200), number of reporting times in the dataset time span
      (max=6), and the number of data type increments (max=3, but more
      realistically 2, u and v)) to allocate the upper limit of a multi-nested
      DO loop in subroutines INCDIST and RESIDST.  The static limit of 1000
      was occasionally being exceeded.
      BENEFIT: This change does not affect the output PREPBUFR file but it does
               improve the statistical evaluation of both legacy (Radar Coded
               Message) and Level 2 decoder VAD wind reports.
   prepobs_prepacqc:
    - In final subroutine which copies all BUFR messages from input to output
      PREPBUFR file (including aircraft reports undated by this program), moved
      BUFRLIB routine OPENMB call to after time-window and geographic-domain
      checks to prevent creation of an empty, but open, BUFR message (of type
      AIRCAR) in (rare) cases where absolutely no aircraft reports pass these
      checks
      BENEFIT: Prevents a BUFRLIB abort due to previous message being open
               when attempting to copy first non-aircraft message from input to
               output PREPBUFR file in such cases where no aircraft reports are
               written back out.  This occurred in the 07z 20140214 RAP_PREP
               production run when the number of aircraft reports was severely
               reduced due to a fiber cut and no reports survived the time-
               window check.
   prepobs_prepdata:
      prepdata (main program):
       - Added processing of Coast Guard tide gauge data (read from SFCSHP
         dump, dump report type 534). A 12'th word added to following namelist
         switches to account for these new reports: FWINDO, JSURFM, JSURFW.
         BENEFIT: Now Coast Guard tide gauge reports are available to be
                  encoded into the PREPBUFR file for all networks that process
                  the SFCSHP dump file.
       - Added new namelist switch NPKRPT (12 elements), if TRUE all of the
         below occurs:
            - Will process surface reports that would otherwise be tossed due
              to their having a missing pstn.
            - These reports estimate pstn from the reported or U.S. Standard
              Atmosphere pmsl, the reported or U.S. Standard Atmosphere
              sensible temperature, and the reported elevation (only marine
              reports > 7.5 m can have a reported pmsl and fall into this
              category). This estimated pstn (POB) is used to estimate q (QOB).
              Both POB and QOB are assigned minimum q.m.'s (PQM, QQM) of 3.
              This estimated POB is encoded into PREPBUFR file.
            - These reports are then assigned new PREPBUFR report types 192/292
              (SYNOP), 193/293 (METAR), 194/294 (marine) and 195/295 (mesonet).
            - ATLAS buoy wind reports which also have missing pstn and pmsl
              will continue to be processed as before (PREPBUFR report type 282
              (Note: This means that if an ATLAS buoy ever had T,q info, its
                     mass piece would still be tossed rather than getting into
                     PREPBUFR file under under report type 194 (may need to fix
                     this logic someday).
            - MESONETS will no longer have "x" in character 8 of id, instead
              they will get PREPBUFR report types 195/295 rather than 188/288.
         BENEFIT: ADPSFC, SFCSHP, and MSONET reports that do not contain
                  station pressure information are now retained (previously,
                  they were discarded) when NPKRPT(x)=TRUE for surface ITYP=x.
                  They are now available for the analysis. Currently all words
                  of NPKRPT are set to TRUE in the NAM/NDAS, RAP, RTMA and URMA
                  networks.
       - Added new mnemonic "PMIN" (mean sea-level pressure indicator) which
         is encoded with a value of zero for all surface reports with an
         observed mean sea-level pressure encoded in "PMO" (currently all
         surface types except mesonet). "PMIN" will be encoded with a value of
         1 in w3emc routine GBLEVENTS for cases where a mean sea-level pressure
         is derived because it was encoded as missing in PREPBUFR file by
         prepobs_prepdata in PREP (e.g., for all mesonet reports) (see
         GBLEVENTS change info above and docblock in GBLEVENTS for more
         information) (See changes #1, 4 & 5 to fix file
         prepobs_prep.bufrtable below.)
         BENEFIT: Downstream codes will be able to differentiate between
                  observed and derived PMO via the PMIN value.
       - Modified subroutine GETC06 to skip over PREPBUFR encoding if u- or
         v-comp of wind (m/sec * 100) exceeds 32767 (a BUFR bit limitation).
         BENEFIT: Erroneously large upper-air wind reports will no longer be
                  encoded into the PREPBUFR file.
       - Modified to always encode wind speed obs in m/sec ("SOB") and wind
         direction obs ("DDO") for all types of surface reports (even if one or
         the other are missing but also if both are present). Removed logic
         which encoded "SOB" only for METAR reports when direction was missing
         and speed was .LE. 3 m/sec (direction was never encoded in any
         situation for surface reports). Also removed encoding of "SQM" (wind
         speed quality mark) for these types of METAR reports.  All surface
         reports now encode wind qm as "WQM" regardless of whether or not it
         also encodes direction, speed, u-comp or v-comp [note this change does
         not affect non-surface reports which can still encode speed in knots
         ("FFO") and direction ("DDO") when "UOB" and "VOB" are also encoded.]
         (See changes #3 & 7 to fix file prepobs_prep.bufrtable below.)
         BENEFIT: Surface data wind reports that have incomplete wind direction
                  or speed information will now be retained so that at least
                  wind speed (or direction) will be available to the GSI. The
                  GSI (or other downstream processing) will now be able to
                  pull SOB and DDO out of PREPBUFR for all surface reports.
       - For all satellite-derived wind reports, now encodes PREPBUFR report
         sub-type (mnemonic "TSB", previously missing) as BUFR satellite id
         times 10 plus "satellite derived wind computation method ("SWCM" -
         BUFR code table 0-02-023).  (See change #6 to fix file
         prepobs_prep.bufrtable below.)
         BENEFIT: Allows GSI to identify cloud-top vs. deep-layer WV winds and
                  IR vs. visible winds for METEOSAT and JMA since, unlike
                  NESDIS, both have same rpt types (250-JMA & 254-EUMETSAT for
                  WV, 242/252-JMA & 243/253-EUMETSAT for IR/VIS)
       - 1-dim array OBS2 returned from IW3UNPBF increased from 42 to 43 words
         to hold satellite zenith angle (degrees, for all satwnd types),
         encoded into PREPBUFR file (mnemonic "SAZA"). (See changes #1 & 2 to
         fix file prepobs_prep.bufrtable below.)
         BENEFIT: For use by GSI (to possibly screen satwnds with high SAZA
                  values).
       - Changed IRNMRK value for Unrestricted Mesoscale Analysis (URMA)
         network from 9 to 10.
         BENEFIT: Allows URMA to have its own RUN mark value, instead of
                  combining it with the RTMA value of 9.
       - Process new VAD wind reports from level 2 decoder. Do not convert
         winds from dir/speed to u/v these are already u/v and are stored in
         m/sec.
         BENEFIT: VAD wind reports from Level 2 decoder can now be processed
                  and encoded into the PREPBUFR file for use by GSI systems.
       - Differentiate between Radar Coded Message and new Level 2 decoder VAD
         wind reports via use of report subtype (TSB=1 for former and =2 for
         latter).
         BENEFIT: Needed by GSI since both types will be in PREPBUFR file.
       - Increase the maximum number of levels that can be processed (MXLVL)
         from 300 to 600.
         BENEFIT: Allows runs that might include interpolated levels (e.g.,
                  special AFOS graphics, IRNMRK=2) to still work properly as
                  more and more radiosonde levels become available in the new
                  RRS.
       - No longer aborts with RC=99 if number of levels in a report exceeds
         the limit of MXLVL (just updated from 300 to 600, see above). Instead,
         now skips the offending report(s) and, at the very end, posts a
         message to the joblog file noting how many reports were skipped due to
         this issue.
         BENEFIT: PREP job will not longer stop dead in its tracks in this
                  case. EMC's monitoring utilities will quickly detect this
                  issue since it will be reported in the joblog file.
       - Report type 183 now stores moisture quality mark no lower than 3
         (suspect) (before type 183 stored observed moisture quality mark read
         from the ADPSFC dump file).
         BENEFIT: The pressure used to generate specific humidty has always
                  been at best suspect.  Now the moisture follows suit.
      iw3unpbf (subroutine):
       - Added ability to read in and process percent confidence based on
         EUMETSAT Quality Indicator with and without forecast for NESDIS GOES
         winds pulled from NESDIS server (which originally stored them in dump
         file explicitly as "QIFY" and "QIFN" but later stored them both as
         before and as replicated "PCCF" values as with v10 BUFR, and even
         later stored them only as replicated "PCCF" values as with v10 BUFR)
         if they are present.
         (Note: As noted, will also work if these are stored in replicated
                "PCCF" values as with v10 BUFR, e.g., MODIS winds, AVHRR winds,
                JMA winds, EUMETSAT winds.)
       - Added ability to read in and process percent confidence based on
         NESDIS Recursive Filter Function for types which might store it in
         dump file in replicated "PCCF" values as with v10 BUFR (in this case
         NESDIS GOES winds, MODIS winds, AVHRR winds, JMA winds - already in
         place for EUMETSAT winds) if it is present.
         (Note: Will still work if this is stored explicitly as "RFFL" as
                originally with GOES winds pulled from NESDIS server.)
       - Added ability to read in and process percent confidence based on
         NESDIS Expected Error for types which might store it in dump file in
         replicated "PCCF" values as with v10 BUFR (in this case MODIS or AVHRR
         winds) if it is present.
         (Note: Will still work if this is stored explicitly as "EEQF" as
                originally with GOES winds pulled from NESDIS server.
       - Now stores cloud-top/deep-layer indicator in byte 3 of header reserve
         character word 1 for foreign-produced satellite winds (as already done
         for NESDIS-produced satellite winds) - JMA and EUMETSAT imager water
         vapor winds can now be of both types, before they were only cloud-top.
       - Output array OBS2 creased from length 42 to 43 words, where word 43
         contains satellite zenith angle (degrees, satwnd types only)
       - Added new dump report type 534 for surface marine Coast Guard tide
         gauge reports.
         BENEFIT: Now Coast Guard tide gauge reports are available to be
                  encoded into the PREPBUFR file for all networks that process
                  the SFCSHP dump file.
      w3unpkb7 (subroutine):
       - Modified to handle VAD wind reports from Level 2 decoder (subset
         "NC002017") in addition to those from Radar Coded Message (subset
         "NC002008")}.
       - Parameterized maximum number of levels allowed for each category and
         calculated parameter "IDMAX" (size of output "RDATA" array) based on
         these.  All of these are now placed in new include file
         'inc_w3unpkb7.inc'.
      inc_w3unpkb7.inc (include file):
       - Maximum number of cat. 04 winds-by-height levels (excluding first,
         surface, level) increased from 64 to 254 to account for more levels in
         new VAD wind reports from Level 2 decoder.
       - Maximum number of cat. 11 wind profiler levels (excluding first,
         surface, level) increased from 102 to 200 to account for some MAP
         profilers with more levels than before.
       - The resulting "IDMAX" is now 2270, up from 1200 before.

 Fixed file changes:
   prepobs_cqc_statbge, prepobs_landc, syndat_weight:
    - No changes to contents.
   prepobs_prep.bufrtable:
    - 1) Added two new mnemonics to Table B: Satellite Zenith Angle (SAZA),
         Mean Sea-Level Indicator (PMIN).
    - 2) Added SAZA to the Table A SATWND mnemonic sequence.
    - 3) Added existing Table D 1-bit repl. sequence <WSPD_SEQ> to Table A
         SFCSHP and MSONET mnemonic sequences.
    - 4) Added PMIN to PMSL_SEQ mnemonic sequence.
    - 5) Added existing Table D 1-bit repl. sequence <PMSL_SEQ> to Table A
         MSONET mnemonic sequence.
    - 6) Increased Table B mnemonic TSB (Report Subtype) bit width from 10 to
         14.
    - 7) Removed Table B mnemonic SQM (wind speed quality marker).  It had been
         a part of Table D sequence WSPD_SEQ.  It was used only by METAR
         reports with missing direction and speed .LE. 3 m/sec when wind speed
         obs was encoded in SOB.  Since all surface reports now encode SOB, the
         wind quality marker (whether UOB and VOB are reported or not) will
         just be encoded in existing menmonic WQM.
   syndat_syndata.slmask.t126.gaussian:
    - Renamed from syndat_slmask.t126.gaussian to distinguish from file in
      /nwprod/tropcy_qc_reloc.v*/fix
    - No changes to contents.
